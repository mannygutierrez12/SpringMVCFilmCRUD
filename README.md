# Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project Overview

In this project, we aim to improve upon the work done in the previous week by using web forms to communicate with the user and the database. The first phase of the project was created during class and was later assigned to a team of two. The purpose of the project is to create a fully functional CRUD application that allows users to interact with a locally hosted database called "sdvid" through a user-friendly interface.

## Outcome

The outcome of this project is to create a fully functional CRUD application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and view film records in the database through a web form interface. Our goal is to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the database.

## Technologies Used

We used the following technologies for this project:

- Java
- Spring
- Git
- StackOverflow
- CodePen
- Zoom
- Slack
- MySQL
- JSP
- HTML
- CSS
- Gradle
- Groovy
- CodePen for CSS examples

## Challenges

During the project, we faced several challenges. One of the main challenges was rewriting the methods using the controller. Despite trying multiple approaches, we still struggled to get it to work properly. Additionally, this was our first time working in teams, so we had to learn to manage our time more effectively and establish clear expectations for team members early on in the project. 

A challenge that I faced while building this project was multiple crashes during the "add a movie" option. I was able to get it up and running, but it still crashed when users tried to enter a rating for the movie. To fix this, I decided to create a radio button option with values that match the options in the database. This prevents users from entering incorrect values and causing crashes.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, we learned how to use Spring MVC to create a web application, how to use JSP and HTML to create dynamic pages, and how to connect to a MySQL database using Java. Additionally, we learned the importance of clear communication and the consequences of a lack of it.

## Improvements

In future projects, we plan to use a separate CSS file instead of in-line text for better maintainability. Additionally, we will have to set up clear expectations for team members and establish roles early on in any future projects. I am still working on this project on a Sunday night, and it is unrealistic that I will finish the project by Monday morning. Time management will be crucial for any future projects. Overall, we learned a lot from this project and look forward to improving upon our skills in future projects.
