## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project Overview
In this project, we will be improving upon the work done in the previous week by using web forms to communicate with the user and the database. The first phase of the project was created during class and was later assigned to a team of two. The purpose of the project is to create a functional full-stack web application using dynamic pages.

## Outcome
We aim to create a fully functional CRUD application that allows users to interact with a locally hosted database called "sdvid" which is already populated, through a user-friendly interface. The purpose of this application is to provide a convenient way for users to add, edit, delete, and view film records in the database. By using a web form interface, users will be able to interact with the database in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.

### Improvements
One of the improvements we plan to make is to use a separate CSS file instead of inline text. We initially used inline text for simplicity, but using a separate CSS file will make it easier to maintain and update the styling of the application.
